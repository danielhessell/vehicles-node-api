## :zap: Technologies

This project was developed with the following technologies:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/)
- [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/)

## :computer: Getting started

Before you begin, you will need to have the following tools installed on your
machine:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com)

The project can be built with npm or yarn, so choose one of the approach bellow
in case you don't have any installed on your system.

Npm is distributed with Node.js which means that when you download Node.js, you
automatically get npm installed on your computer.

- [Node.js v22.11.0](https://nodejs.org/) or heigher.

The project uses a database (MongoDB), it is necessary to have it on your machine so that you can run it. If not, I suggest using Docker Compose to run a container with the mongodb image.

- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

<details>
<summary>How to run database with Docker Compose locally (linux)</summary>

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Also, itâ€™s good to have an editor to work with the code like
[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
